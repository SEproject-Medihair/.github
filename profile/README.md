## 📖 Proposal
Throughout the ages, hair has always occupied an important place in human society. However, over time, environmental pollution, social concerns and the improper use of various chemicals have exacerbated the problem of hair loss. Nowadays, this problem is affecting younger and younger people, showing a trend of earlier age of onset.   

With the growing demand for hair loss treatments, various products such as hair loss shampoos and medications have come into existence. In addition, advances in technology have made it possible to popularize home medical devices. In 2020, South Korea's LG Electronics launched its hair care product, LG Pra.L MediHair, which attracted a lot of attention.

However, it is worth noting that treating hair loss is not an overnight process and requires consistent use over time. In order to prevent hair loss patients from giving up on the treatment due to the lack of immediate results, we have added features such as reminders and visualization of the treatment progress comparison chart to the device. These improvements provide users with a more intuitive way to monitor hair loss treatments.   

In addition, we offer personalized prevention and treatment plans based on the user's age and scalp condition. In short, this application is designed to help users treat hair loss more effectively.
