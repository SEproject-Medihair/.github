2023 한양대학교 소프트웨어공학 프로젝트 with LG Pra.L Medihair
# Proposal
Hair has held a significant position in human society throughout history. However, with time, issues like environmental pollution, social concerns, and improper use of various chemicals have exacerbated the problem of hair loss among people. This issue is now affecting individuals at a younger age, demonstrating a trend towards earlier onset.    

As the demand for hair loss treatment has grown, various products such as hair loss shampoos and medications have emerged. Additionally, advancements in technology have made it possible for at-home medical devices to become readily available. In 2020, South Korean company LG Electronics introduced its hair care product, LG Pra.L MediHair, which garnered considerable attention.

However, it's important to note that treating hair loss is not an overnight process and requires consistent, long-term usage. To prevent individuals from giving up due to a lack of immediate results, we have incorporated features like reminders and visual comparison charts of treatment progress in our device. These enhancements provide users with a more intuitive way to monitor their hair loss treatment.    

Furthermore, we offer personalized preventive and treatment solutions based on users' age and scalp condition. We also recommend medications and shampoos that can be used in conjunction with the Pra.L MediHair device. In essence, this application aims to assist users in a more effective utilization of the Pra.L MediHair machine for hair loss treatment.
